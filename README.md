## Welcome to my study on Quantum Cryptography<br>
This study focuses on the nature in which quantum computing can help enchance network security mainly cryptography.<br>
The study was carried out with the help of my team members and many other research paper for reference.<br>
The above document and power point presentation shall contain the outcomes of my study.<br>
The result of the study is to develop a basic algorithm of how data during transmission is encrypted and decrypted.
